Save the attached logo image to this repository as `public/logo.png`.

Steps:
1. Download the image you attached in this chat.
2. Place it in the project root `public` folder with the name `logo.png`.
   - Path: public/logo.png
3. Restart the dev server (`npm run dev`) if it's running.

Notes:
- Vite serves files in `public` at the site root, so the app will load the file at `/logo.png`.
- If you prefer a different filename or path, update the `src` attribute in `App.tsx` accordingly.
